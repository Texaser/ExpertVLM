        "The player does a good job of keeping the ball close, ensuring it is under control. The positioning of the feet close together, while noted as a limitation for getting lower and improving balance, change of direction, and speed, indicates a controlled dribbling technique. The player correctly positions the foot with the heel up and toe down, allowing for contact through the middle of the ball with the laces, which is desirable for dribbling in a regular running stride. Additionally, maintaining eye contact with the opponent is highlighted as a positive aspect."

Notably, the player does a quick pivot before contacting the ball at a slightly higher point with a little knee bend in the standing leg, improving balance and control. By bringing the knee inside and the lower leg out, the player presents the inside of the foot at the middle of the ball with a very straight angle, facilitating a flat surface contact for an upward ball trajectory. The controlled distance between the ball and the body, alongside an effective body position with the standing leg, underscores the player's exemplary control and balance throughout the juggling exercise."
