This positioning also provides more room for knee action, allowing for better contact with the ball in front of the body as the leg swings down and through the ball.",

This positioning limits knee action slightly, sacrificing potential contact with the ball behind the body as the leg swings down and through the ball.",

This positioning also provides more room for knee action, combined with a quick sidestep before swinging through to allow better contact with the ball in front of the body.",
